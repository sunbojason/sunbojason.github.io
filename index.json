Based on an improved weight updating criterion that eliminates the requirement of initial admissible control, the control law is obtained approximately by online training of a single critic network. The Lyapunov stability and the Zeno phenomenon of the closed-loop system are analysed. The feasibility of the established algorithm is verified by applying it to an optimal stabilization task of a nonlinear aeroelastic system.

This integral is further reorganized as a weighted sum of a series of classical failure probabilities by Gaussian quadrature, and the series of the classical failure probabilities have the similar limit state function constructions constrained by different thresholds. Secondly, MCS is used according to the probability input distribution to generate the sample pool, in which the active learning Kriging is used to establish the surrogates of the series of similar limit state functions with different thresholds. An improved learning function is proposed by minimizing the U-learning function minima corresponding to all limit state functions, so that the candidate with the largest effect on the surrogating quality of all limit states can be selected as a training point to update the Kriging model. Once the updating process of the Kriging model converges, all limit state functions can be identified by the Kriging model, and the profust failure probability can be estimated by using the Kriging model without any extra model evaluation.

However, efficiently estimating the global reliability sensitivity index is still a challenge for engineering structures with rare failure events and implicit complex limit state functions. Thus, a novel method by combining the dynamic Kriging with Monte Carlo simulation (abbreviated as DK-MCS) is proposed for addressing this issue. The novelty of DK-MCS is twofold. One advantage is that the DK model is inserted in MCS process for accurately recognizing failure samples from all MCS samples by the iteratively updated DK model instead of the actual implicit limit state function, thus the computational cost of DK-MCS is significantly less than that of MCS while the precision of DK-MCS is the same as that of MCS. The other is that a new criteria is presented for selecting informative training points to effectively refine the DK model, where the informative training points with the largest contribution to the failure probability are selected by the cross validation method. Therefore, the iteration process for building the DK model can converge more rapidly. Several examples demonstrate the proposed DK-MCS method can greatly save computational cost of estimating the global reliability sensitivity indices and keep the same precision as MCS.","tags":["Reliability","Aerospace Engineering"],"title":"An efficient method for estimating global reliability sensitivity indices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chunyan Ling","Zhenzhou Lu","Kaixuan Feng","Bo Sun"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1550188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550188800,"objectID":"61bee64d1493a396bf24e046f6fce518","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/publication/jr_2019_smo_chunyan/","publishdate":"2019-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jr_2019_smo_chunyan/","section":"publication","summary":"For the problem with a fuzzy failure state which commonly exists in degradation structures and systems, the fuzzy failure probability based importance measure indices can be used to measure the effect of the input variables on the fuzzy failure probability effectively. However, the computational cost is unaffordable for estimating the indices directly. For efficiently evaluating the fuzzy failure probability based importance measure indices, this paper proposed two numerical simulation methods, i.e., the direct Monte Carlo simulation method based on the Bayesian formula (B-DMCS) and the adaptive radial-based importance sampling method based on the Bayesian formula (B-ARBIS). The two proposed methods employ the Bayesian formula to eliminate the dependence of the computational cost on the dimensionality of the input variables. Compared with the B-DMCS method, the B-ARBIS method can enhance the computational efficiency significantly due to repeatedly utilizing the same group of samples of the input variables and the strategy to adaptively search the optimal hypersphere in the safety domain. After giving the principles and implementations of the two methods, three examples are employed to validate the effectiveness of the two proposed numerical simulation methods. The results of the examples demonstrate that the effectiveness of the two proposed methods is higher than the direct Monte Carlo method, and the B-ARBIS method can improve the efficiency obviously in contrast with the B-DMCS method.","tags":["Reliability","Aerospace Engineering"],"title":"Efficient numerical simulation methods for estimating fuzzy failure probability based importance measure indices","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?

The proposed control approaches have the capability of online learning and adapting to new circumstances, which enable the aircraft to tolerate actuator faults, structural damage and atmospheric disturbances.\n","date":1538006400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538006400,"objectID":"76aa8a1f3e374ecc6d5bf5a217200265","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/project/fault-tolerant/","publishdate":"2018-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fault-tolerant/","section":"project","summary":"Advanced flight controller design using reinforcement learning-based approaches to improve aircraft safety in the presence of actuator faults and structural damages.","tags":["Reinforcement Learning","Aerospace Engineering","Adaptive Control"],"title":"Aircraft Fault Tolerant Control","type":"project"},{"authors":["Xiaofei Chang","Bo Sun","Jie Yan","Wenxing Fu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537401600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537401600,"objectID":"7a2b27c3a17f440eccceff8775aaf02f","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/publication/cf_2018_ieee_icmae/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/cf_2018_ieee_icmae/","section":"publication","summary":"To intercept higher-speed maneuvering target, interception modes are analyzed and head-on posture with maneuverable advantage of interceptor is determined to be the prerequisite. A differential game-based guidance law is proposed under the framework of model predictive control. Gradient-iteration algorithm subject to input constraints is implemented for on-line optimization with respect to a composite objective functional consisting of line-of-sight rate and fuel consumption. Algorithm's effectiveness for obtaining saddle points of the game is derived on some preconditions. The numerical simulation results show the importance of choosing suitable cost weights and validate the performance of the guidance law. The accessible zone against higher-speed maneuvering penetrator involving varying initial conditions is computed by assuming the other vehicle moves optimally.","tags":["Aerospace Engineering","Adaptive Control"],"title":"A Game-Based Guidance Law Against Higher-Speed Maneuvering Penetrator Using Model Predictive Method","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Under construction\u0026hellip;\n","date":1524787200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524787200,"objectID":"f9d86f13016aa61d3c177f138477639c","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/project/guidance-law/","publishdate":"2018-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/guidance-law/","section":"project","summary":"Aircraft guidance law design and analysis against the faster manuvering penetrator.","tags":["Adaptive Control","Aerospace Engineering"],"title":"Aircraft Guidance Law Design and Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Under construction\u0026hellip;\n","date":1506470400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1506470400,"objectID":"7926fe13e26fae6af0767cc494f01033","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/project/hardware-simulation/","publishdate":"2017-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hardware-simulation/","section":"project","summary":"Hardware-in-the-Loop simulation for a miniature moitering aircraft.","tags":["Aerospace Engineering"],"title":"Hardware-in-the-loop simulation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Under construction\u0026hellip;\n","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"accdb97b0d00c7cc31f483bb963c5faa","permalink":"https://sunbojason.github.io/project/reliability/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/reliability/","section":"project","summary":"Novel reliability analysis approach design via simulation modeling.","tags":["Reliability","Aerospace Engineering"],"title":"Reliability Analysis","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"All these three programs were fully funded by the national funding with 20,000 RMB, and won the excellent conclusion (\u0026lt;20%).
